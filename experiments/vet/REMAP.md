# Remap Manifest — mycelium-std-vsa → std.vsa

_DN-109 §5.2 provenance ledger. Guarantee: **Declared** — this records proposed/performed structural and idiom choices; it does not certify them (no guarantee-tag upgrade from the manifest's existence alone, VR-5). Rendered from `remap` in `summary.json` — this file is a pure projection, never a second source of truth._

## Nodules (5)

| Target nodule | Operation | Safety | API surface changed | Identity neutral | Sources | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `std.vsa.encoding` | Keep | Safe | false | true | `/root/git/isolated/mycelium/crates/mycelium-std-vsa/src/encoding.rs` | structure-preserving 1:1 (DN-109 §5.3-B v0 default: every emitted nodule keeps its source file's mod-tree position, no restructuring proposed) |
| `std.vsa` | Keep | Safe | false | true | `/root/git/isolated/mycelium/crates/mycelium-std-vsa/src/lib.rs` | structure-preserving 1:1 (DN-109 §5.3-B v0 default: every emitted nodule keeps its source file's mod-tree position, no restructuring proposed) |
| `std.vsa.matrix` | Keep | Safe | false | true | `/root/git/isolated/mycelium/crates/mycelium-std-vsa/src/matrix.rs` | structure-preserving 1:1 (DN-109 §5.3-B v0 default: every emitted nodule keeps its source file's mod-tree position, no restructuring proposed) |
